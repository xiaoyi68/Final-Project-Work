# Population Prediction: Machine Learning Deep Dive

### Our team wanted to explore the population trends for each state in the United States for the next three years. We decided to use multiple linear regression models to understand how the population will change. However, we needed input features to feed into our model in order to predict population changes. After researching population data we decided to use Births, Deaths, Migration, Labor Force, and Unemployment rate data for each state. We used this data from the USDA for each state from 2011-2018. Our input features were then predicted to understand how they will change over a three year period. Then, we fed those input features to predict our population predictions. Our methods were unique because we used predictions to predict our population trends. We applied the model to all fifty states. We used a python libary called SKlearn to develop the models in Jupyter Notebook. We cleaned and maintained our data using Pandas, and we used Matplotlib to develop our plots. Our final visualizations were done in Tableau and our final presentation was done using Powerpoint and Tableau Public.
